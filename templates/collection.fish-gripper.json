The worst thing you can do is to grab the fish through the gill openings. You can cut your fingers doing this on some species, but the fish is more likely to die if you damage their gills. A good fish gripper is the best way to get control to harvest or release the fish safely. While there is such a thing as a net grip, that type of grip is expensive, awkward to use, and duplicates most of the function of the net itself. Stick with the basics. Manufacturers design lip grips to allow you to quickly control the fish without causing harm. </p><p>Lip grippers come with and without a scale. Of course, the advantage of the fish gripper with the scale is to provide instant feedback on the weight of your fish. But, for most anglers, the basic lip gripper is all you need.</p><p>When considering buying a fish gripper, there are a few factors to consider:</p><p>In summary, fish grippers protect the fish from harm. Since most freshwater anglers practice catch and release, using a fish gripper supports that ethic. For anglers who harvest fish, a fish gripper allows the angler to get the fish under control without risking personal injury from sharp teeth or gills.</p>"

Typically, most anglers do not need a large fish gripper. One at least eight inches long is suitable for most fresh and inshore saltwater fish.</p>"
