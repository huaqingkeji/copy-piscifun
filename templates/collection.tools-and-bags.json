            "title": "Buyers Guide for Fishing Tools and Bags",
            "answer": "<p>It's a common joke that you still need more when you know how much fishing gear you already have. No matter what you have, the common challenge is organizing it and getting it to the water's edge. Before looking at how you efficiently transport all that fishing gear, you must ensure you have the bare-bones fishing tools. Thankfully, there are only three essential tools you need.</p><h5><strong>Critical fishing tools:</strong> </h5><p>Spooler, Pliers, Scissors, and Fish Gripper: The first tool you should use before leaving the house. If you have not spooled your fishing line onto your fishing reel correctly, you will have a day of frustration as the line tangles on every cast. Therefore, every angler should have a good <a href=\"https://www.piscifun.com/collections/fishing-line-spooler\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Fishing Line Spooler\">fishing line spooler</a>. Beyond that, it is simple. You only need a set of pliers, scissors, and a fish lip gripper to land your catch. However, there are efficiencies to be gained! Your pliers should include a cutter and eliminate the need for a separate set of scissors. In addition, the <a href=\"https://www.piscifun.com/collections/fishing-pliers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Fishing Pliers\">pliers</a> should have a split ring separator and slots to crimp sleeves or split shots. Be sure the pliers are made of rust-resistant metal, such as aluminum or stainless steel. A good fish lip gripper can include the ability to weigh the fish.</p><h5><strong>Transport:</strong> </h5><p>Chances are you will take more than just a couple of boxes of lures when fishing. You probably have your lunch, rain gear, water, insect repellent, and other comfort items. Thankfully there are many options of tackle bags or backpacks to choose from depending on how much \"stuff\" you need. Those fishing from a boat has the flexibility to pack more tackle boxes than an angler hiking next to a mountain stream. Let's look at some of the options and associated considerations.</p><p>Manufacturers who make the best tackle bags or fishing bags customize them to fit standard tackle boxes. <a href=\"https://www.piscifun.com/collections/tackle-bags\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tackle Bags\">Tackle bags</a> and fishing bags come in different sizes to hold different quantities of tackle boxes. Here is one approach to selecting the best size. Segregate your lures by season or species on the garage floor. The size of the largest pile dictates the minimum size bag you should buy since the tackle bag or fishing bag must accommodate the maximum number of boxes. </p><p>If you only have a few boxes, a fishing tackle backpack makes it easy to get them from your vehicle to the water. Tackle backpacks come in different sizes, and some include tackle trays. Regardless of how many trays you need, the fishing backpack should have plenty of compartments for all your other comfort items and slots specifically made to hold your fishing tools. A few indications of quality include double zippers, double stitching, high-quality nylon material rated at least 1000D nylon (1200D is better), rain protection, ergonomic design, adjustable waistband, and internal partitions. If the tackle backpack has a rod holder, reflective strips, and a hardened compartment for your sunglasses, you know you are at the top of the line.</p><p>If you take long hikes into the backcountry, the fishing backpack must be large enough to include emergency supplies. However, if only going on a day trip, you should consider the smaller backpacks, family packs, or sling tackle bag options. These are sized to hold a curated number of lures, tools, and required comfort items. In particular, a fishing backpack that can be used as a sling bag or a traditional backpack is handy when scrambling over rocks to get to the next beautiful pool on that mountain stream. The best choices always have front pockets for easy access to the items you constantly use.</p>"
