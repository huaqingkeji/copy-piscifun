            "title": "Buyer's Guide for Fly Fishing Reels",
            "answer": "<p>You have an easier decision when looking at fly fishing reels for sale. Selecting a fly fishing reel is more straightforward than choosing a spinning reel or a baitcasting fishing reel because there are fewer characteristics to consider. For most anglers, the flyfishing reel is merely a tool to hold the line. However, even with that simple purpose, you should consider size, arbor, drag, and construction. There are three types of fly reels – single action, multiplier, and automatic. Typically, fly anglers avoid multiplier and automatic reels because the first is prone to backlash, and the second is heavy. Using an industry-standard single-action reel with a 1:1 gear ratio is best.</p><p>Before getting into the details of comparing different fly fishing reels, you must decide what type of fish you will pursue. Fishing for small brook trout on mountain streams requires a different rod, reel, and line combination than going after heavy saltwater fish. Yes, all three elements of the fly fishing setup must match! Fly fishing reel sizes are based on the size of the fly fishing line. Typically, fishing for trout only requires a 3/4 weight rod, reel, and line combination, while bass push the angler to a 5/6 weight fly fishing reel. Larger fish, musky, pike, and saltwater species move the requirement to a 7/8 weight or larger size. The numbers 5/6 and 7/8 indicate the weight of the fly line. Remember, you cast the line, not the lure. For example, manufacturers size a 5/6-weight flyfishing reel to hold the industry-standard amount of backing and a five or six-weight fly line. Likewise, fly fishing rods use the same language to describe the type of fly line optimized for use on that rod. Again, the rod, line, and reel all must match!</p><h5><strong>Size:</strong> </h5><p>Since size is directly related to the target species, there is little choice associated with this characteristic. If you are pursuing large fish, use a large fly reel made for a 7/8 weight line. Smaller fish, smaller reel – one sized for 3/4 or 5/6 weight. Thankfully, the fly line comes in standard lengths of either 90 or 100 feet. Since the lighter line is thinner, the flyfishing reel will hold the matching line length along with a decent backing. </p><h5><strong>Arbor:</strong> </h5><p>This characteristic is the first one that makes a difference in how the reel functions. Arbors come in three basic sizes, small, mid, and large. The circumference of the arbor dictates how many lines you reel in with each turn of the handle. A small arbor fly fishing reel requires many turns of the handle to retrieve the same length of the line as a large arbor reel (the gear ratio is 1:1). Additionally, a mid or large arbor fly fishing reel will hold more backing than a small one. Remember, the fly fishing line is usually either 90 or 100 feet. Therefore, if you need more lines to work a large fish, that function moves to the backing. Reels with more backing allow the fish to run farther during the fight. The best choice is to go with a mid-arbor fly fishing reel.</p><h5><strong>Drag:</strong> </h5><p>No matter what size flyfishing reel you use, it should have a sealed drag to prevent the intrusion of sand and grit. Chances are you will never use the drag when fishing for trout or bass. Smaller fish like these typically never get the line \"on the reel.\" Instead, the angler manages the tension to protect the line from breaking by manually adjusting the line versus the rod bends. The drag becomes critical when pursuing larger fish. For large pike, musky, and saltwater species, it is routine that the fish will run and require more lines to handle. Landing those fish demands a high-quality drag. Avoid any drag made from cork or felt. Those materials erode quickly and may develop hotspots – slick areas where the drag will skip and jerk. The best choice is to look for a drag that uses carbon fiber discs. These are virtually indestructible. Some older fly reels have a drag system called \"click and pawl.\" Avoid any fly fishing reel using this ancient technology. Click and pawl fly reels are not as effective as reels using a modern drag system based on carbon fiber discs. </p><h5><strong>Construction:</strong> </h5><p>Always look for CNC-machined aluminum. Avoid any fly reel made of any other material since it will either be heavy or prone to corrosion. Ideally, the reel you select should advertise \"aircraft quality aluminum.\" It is premium quality if the reel is made from 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum alloy. Beyond the material, the design matters. A pretty design is not just for the aesthetic. The reel's weight becomes critical since fly fishing involves more arm movement than spin or baitcasting. Lighter reels feature larger cutout areas to minimize the overall weight. However, be sure that the design does not make the reel prone to damage when dropped, which is where aircraft-grade aluminum comes into play. It retains its strength even when extensively machined. Another very significant feature to check is the fit. Fly fishing reels separate into two halves. Verify there is no gap between the two halves when joined. If there is a gap, it is likely to catch the fly line.</p><p>Back to the earlier critical point for emphasis, the flyfishing reel setup must match the line and the rod. Manufacturers optimize fly fishing rods to the weight of the fly line! Using a 5/6 weight line on a 7/8 rod produces poor casting performance. Therefore, if you intend to pursue a wide range of fish species ranging from trout to heavy saltwater fish, you must buy the appropriate size flyfishing reel, line, and rod for each.</p>"
